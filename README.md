# Optimized Parser Engine
After 9 year of experience working with various companies, I have realized something that if you want to improve something in this world. You need to step forward and take that responsibility by yourself instead of feature/bugs request. So i have decided after various burnout to make this engine for parsing unstructured data in more optimized way.<br>
This project i'm building to parsing data (**Presently my focus on Log parsing**) using regular expressions and data type conversion.
